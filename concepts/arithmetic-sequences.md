### Basic

sequence: Ordered lists of numbers
term: Each number in a sequence

| number | 3     | 5      | 7     | 9      |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| term   | first | second | third | fourth |

arithmetic sequence: the pattern involves adding or subtracting a number to each term to get the next term.

### Pattern, Formula, Examples

Formula

```latex
a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d
```

Examples

- Add four to the previous term: 1, 4, 9, 13, ...
- Subtract one to the previous term: -5, -4, -3, -2, ...

### The common difference

an arithmetic sequence is the constant difference between consecutive terms.
